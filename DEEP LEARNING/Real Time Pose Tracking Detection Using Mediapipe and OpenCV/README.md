Real_Time_Pose_Tracking_Detection_Using_Mediapipe_and_OpenCV

Implemented a comprehensive system for analyzing human body movements in videos leveraging deep learning techniques and the MediaPipe library. Utilized the MediaPipe Pose model to detect key points on the human body and track their movements in real-time. Incorporated Computer Vision methodologies to extract spatial positions and trajectories of body parts, facilitating detailed analysis of movement dynamics.
